        <h2>Paulo's Story</h2>
        <p>Paulo started coming around our house one day. I had seen quite a few stray cats around here, but not him. He was very friendly. I was planning on asking around to see if he belonged to anyone, and if not I was going to take him in. My boyfriend learned not much later that he belonged to our neighbor and was an indoor/outdoor cat. Now Paulo loves to hangout with us. We can always assume around 6-7pm, he'll be at our house. Sometimes he waits for the garage door to open and he sneaks in.</p>
