        <h1>The Beans</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my (incredibly simple) little website dedicated to my beans (aka my pets).</p>
        <p>I have two dogs, Emmy and Stella, two cats, Finn and Izzy, and one he-adopted-us cat, Paulo.</p>

        <h3>Stella</h3>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Stella is a slightly-insane 5-year-old lab/pitbull/who-knows-what mix that hears and sees everything.</p>

        <p>Finn is a silky 1-year-old orange cat with a never-ending desire for treats.</p>
        <h3>Izzy</h3>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Izzy is a fluffy 1-year-old orange cat who does what she wants, when she wants, and nobody is going to stop her.</p>

        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Paulo is a hefty indoor/outdoor black cat that belongs to my neighbor but adopted me and my boyfriend.</p>
