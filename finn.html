        <h2>Finn's Story</h2>
        <p>Finn was found by my boyfriend's mom when he was only a few weeks old. He was in the parking lot where she works with his little paws frozen to the rim of a tire.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Finn did not take long at all to love being in a warm house, getting cuddles, yelling for more treats, and hanging out with Emmy.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Now Finn likes to spend his days sleeping under his blankie and his nights running around with Izzy and pawing toy mice under the couch.</p>
