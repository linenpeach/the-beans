        <h2>Finn's Story</h2>
        <p>Finn was found by my boyfriend's mom when he was only a few weeks old. He was in the parking lot where she works with his little paws frozen to the rim of a tire. Finn did not take long at all to love being in a warm house, getting cuddles, yelling for more treats, and hanging out with Emmy.Now Finn likes to spend his days sleeping under his blankie and his nights running around with Izzy and pawing toy mice under the couch.</p>
