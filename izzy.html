        <h2>Izzy's Story</h2>
        <p>Izzy was picked up by my local Animal Control. The picture they posted of her looked identical to Finn.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>We went to see her, but she was scared and wanted nothing to do with us. The worker at Animal Control tried to get us to adopt a "friendlier cat", but we knew we wanted her.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Now Izzy is the loviest, cuddliest girl ever. I think she would velcro herself to me 24/7 if she could.</p>
