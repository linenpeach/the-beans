        <h2>Izzy's Story</h2>
        <p>Izzy was picked up by my local Animal Control. The picture they posted of her looked identical to Finn. We went to see her, but she was scared and wanted nothing to do with us. The worker at Animal Control tried to get us to adopt a "friendlier cat", but we knew we wanted her. Now Izzy is the loviest, cuddliest girl ever. I think she would velcro herself to me 24/7 if she could.</p>
