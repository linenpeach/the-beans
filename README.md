# The Beans

This is a simple HTML-only website that introduces my beans (aka my pets) -- Emmy, Stella, Finn, Izzy, and Paulo.

## Purpose

This is my very first self-directed project.

My intentions when creating this website were to practice and/or become more comfortable with:
- Setting up HTML documents with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, and `<title>`
- Basic HTML elements such as `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<img>`
- Styling text in HTML with `<em>` and `<strong>`
- Adding attributes such as `href`, `src`, `alt`, and `target`
- Using git and GitHub
- Using the terminal and a code editor (as opposed to a playground-style environment)

And also to:
- Show you cute pictures of my beans because I have too many of them :)
- Have fun with my first project

## How It's Made

****Tech used:**** HTML

## What I Learned
Things I didn't know going into this project that I now know:
- How to create a simple GitHub pages site for your repository
- How to use the code element in HTML (`<code>`) to denote a snippet of inline code
- How to debug the use of the code element using HTML entities (such as `&lt;` and `&gt;` for `<` and `>`, respectively)
- How to use the inspect element in the browser to test visual changes (such as image width) before adding them to my project
