        <h2>Stella's Story</h2>
        <p>My parents got Stella around May of 2019. She was a scaredy cat immediately.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Stella took some time to adjust to living with us, but she really took to Emmy. We joke that Emmy is Stella's emotional support animal. When I moved out, we decided Stella was too bonded to Emmy to separate them, so I adopted Stella.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Now Stella is the guardian of the house. She knows everything that's going on at all times. But don't actually come near her because she will run and hide.</p>
